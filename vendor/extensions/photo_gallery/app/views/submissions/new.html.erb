	<h2>Upload Your Photos and Artwork to the YBP Gallery.</h2>
	<p>Since we started in ‘06, Yellow Bird Peeps have been emailing us pics and artwork unprompted. Inspired by the support and enthusiasm for YBP, we decided to dedicate a cozy little corner of our site to just such imagery. Upload your stuff now and show Yellow Bird Project some love.
	</p>
	<p>If you want to upload a photo of you in your Yellow Bird Project shirt, here’s what we recommend: Just take a photo of yourself wearing your Yellow Bird Project shirt, keeping in mind that the art on the shirt must be at least 3/4 visible in the photo and your photo will be cropped. Done? Now just follow the steps below…</p>
